            <h3>Hi :)</h3>
            <p>I'm a Graduating Senior Computer Engineering student from New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I originally started my career down the hardware and digital design path. After many classes and passion changes, I ended up in this software engineering world and I really have grown to love it.</p><p> Since August 2014, I've been learning and coding as much as I can and I love it more everyday. I have a strong desire to make things better in this world, whether it be through advocating for improvement, extending a helping hand, or physically creating and coding something. Most recently my attention has been on improving things on my campus, both in the education world and educating the newer students on things they should be doing now to give themselves the best chance to be successful. Some of these initiatives include unofficial tutoring sessions for difficult classes, advocating for changed curriculum to stay relevant, and running and organizing a panel of senior classmates to give information and answer questions for the incoming freshman and sophomores.</p>

                <p>On the technical side, I've been exposed to many different areas. Throughout my internships and classes, I've spent a lot of time reading books and learning the data structures and algorithms side of things. I am even taking our advanced data structures and algorithms class here at NJIT for fun! I have no dream position, I would like to be involved in many different areas whether it be fullstack, mobile, platform etc.</p>
